To provide clean clothes to those who need them through transparent methods using the latest digital technologies and social media.
We are designing this Mobile app for donating unwanted old clothes. To use the app, users simply snap a photo of the item they would like to give away and then answer a few short questions. The app will then match the item with the appropriate charity and reach out to the user to schedule a pick-up time.

## My role in this project:

Login, Register, Home, Active donations, and Profile,Chat history,Chat window.
